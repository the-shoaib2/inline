// It was a glorious evening at the Dacca Stadium. Bangladesh had just pulled off a nail-biting victory against India - the crowd roared, screamed, and the commentators were practically losing their voices.

// Among the delightful fans were two ‘trilliant’ coders from DIU_ACM, both coincidentally named
// H
// a
// m
// j
// a
// a
// .
// Hamjaa. Yes, Hamjaa and Hamjaa - a debugging duo who usually spend their nights fixing segmentation faults but today were celebrating football magic.

// After the match, they got the golden chance to enter the dressing room of the Bangladesh team. The atmosphere inside was electric - sweaty jerseys, tactical banter, and the smell of victory. Just as they were soaking in the moment, in walked the footballer Hamzaa.

// Now imagine this:

// The teammates shout, “Hamzaa!”

// Both Hamjaas perk up, “Yes?”

// Hamzaa himself replies, “Yes?”

// It was like a live coding contest where every variable had the same name. Absolute chaos.

// The dressing room turned into a comedy sketch:

// One teammate yelled, “Pass the water to Hamzaa!”

// Three hands shot up.

// Another shouted, “Hamzaa, sit here!”

// Suddenly, three people tried to sit on the same chair.

// Now, your job as a programmer is to print the name of the Footballer. Yes, the name of the footballer, not the coders.

// Input
// There is No input for this Problem.

// Output
// Print the name of the
// F
// o
// o
// t
// b
// a
// l

// e
// r
// Footballer mentioned above.

// Example
// Input	Output
// Hamzaa

// Be careful about the newline(‘\n’) at the end.
